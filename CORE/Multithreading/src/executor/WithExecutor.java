/*
The Executor Framework in Java is used for managing and controlling multiple threads efficiently. Instead of manually creating and managing threads,
it provides a pool of worker threads that can execute tasks asynchronously.

ðŸ”¹ Better Performance: Reduces thread creation overhead.
ðŸ”¹ Thread Reusability: Uses a thread pool instead of creating new threads.
ðŸ”¹ Better Control: You can schedule, limit, and monitor threads.
ðŸ”¹ Automatic Thread Management: No need to manually start, stop, or join threads.

âœ… Benefits of Using Executor Framework:
âœ” Thread Pooling â†’ Reuses existing threads.
âœ” Efficient Resource Management â†’ Controls the number of threads.
âœ” Easy Task Submission â†’ Just submit() or execute().
âœ” Built-in Scheduling â†’ Allows running tasks at specific times.
