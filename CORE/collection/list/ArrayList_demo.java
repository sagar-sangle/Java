/*Java ArrayList is a part of collections framework and it is a class of java.util package. 
It provides us with dynamic arrays in Java. Though, it may be slower than standard arrays but can be helpful in programs 
where lots of manipulation in array is required. The main advantage of ArrayList is, unlike normal arrays, 
we donâ€™t need to mention the size when creating ArrayList. It automatically adjusts its capacity as elements are added or removed. */
