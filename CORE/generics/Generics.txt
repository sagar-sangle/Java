what is Generics ? 
-> Generics means parametrized Type genrics was defined in java 5 generics are used when we want to pass Parametrs 
to classes and interfaces and methods to provide comiple type safty and prevent type casting 

issue without genrics :
1)  TypeCasting 
2)Manual Checking 
3)No compile time Checking

with using generics u can avoid all these.
